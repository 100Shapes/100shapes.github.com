	<h1>Good Design</h1>
<h3 class="summary">Designing is hard. Here&#39;s how you can measure the sucess of a design to improve your own products and services. I&#39;m an Interaction designer at 100Shapes and this is my perspective on how I think about design.</h3>

<h2>How do you <em>know</em> when a design's good?</h2>
<p>I've asked every User Experience (UX) candidate the same question. Here's some things I've heard people say:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It looks good"</li>
<li>"It pushes boundaries and breaks the rules"</li>
<li>"It's usable"</li>
<li>"It solves a problem"</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think many people would disagree with the last one – most people would say that designing is about solving a problem. This means a good design just solves a problem well.</p>
<p>When we talk about good design, we're talking about its ability to solve a problem. They are the same thing.</p>
<p>Now we have something to work with: to solve a problem, we need to understand it. For me, good design starts with the question "What am I trying to solve?". When I can answer that, I have something to measure the success of the design.</p>

<h2>What's the problem?</h2>
<p>When you understand a problem, it's easier to solve. Understanding it means you can quickly tell if a new suggestion is a better answer. When you have lots of solutions, you can choose the best fit. </p>
<p>The best fit is the best solution. The best solution is the best design.</p>
<p>Sometimes the problem might be simple: "get more downloads" or "make more money".</p>
<p>Within the UX field, we have lots of ways to help understand a problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholder Interviews</li>
<li>Diary studies</li>
<li>Competitor Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Each method tells its own story about the problem. By choosing the right one, you get a better understanding of what you're trying to solve. Read up on these techniques and use them in your design process. If you're not a designer, think about the tools you could use to give you answers to your problem.</p>
<p>When you know what the problem is, and what you want to achieve, you can start to think about how you want to achieve it.</p>
<h2>Finding Answers</h2>
<p>That's not it though. We're missing a key component: the people that use a design.</p>
<h2>User Testing</h2>
<p>If a design isn't used, it's not solving anything. If it <em>can't</em> be used, it's even worse. </p>

<p>Within the UX field, we have </p>

o the same. </p>
<p>I consider myself a designer: I look at problems and try to solve them. Designers want to create <em>good designs</em>, but how do you know when a design actually is good?</p>
<p>What is a good design?</p>
<p>Is it something that looks good? Perhaps it pushes boundaries in some way – paves the way for a better future. Maybe good design is about making a valuable contribution to the world.</p>
