					<h1>Testing MOO.com</h1>
				</div>
				<p>The guys at MOO are true advocates of user-centred design and, as such, brought us on board to thoroughly test and check their products to get the very best out of them. We tested a wonderfully simple tool that helps non-designer types create beautiful and professional business cards in no time at all. Here’s a little bit about when we got them the best out of usability testing...</p>

				<span>THE PROCESS</span>
				<h2>Understanding the goals</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To get the most honest insights out of a testing session, it’s important for us to understand exactly what you want to find out. We spent time getting to know the guys at MOO, talking through the purpose of their new tool and understanding what they wanted to find out. Our testers are all designers themselves, so there’s nothing they enjoy more than critiquing a design and nattering over the merits of a button or two.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Preparation is the key</h2>
			<p>Everyone involved in a creating new product wants to find out something specific from testing. The MOO team put together a list of questions they wanted answers to. That list formed the basis of our discussion guide - a carefully crafted script that our testers use to divulge open and honest reactions from participants. And of course practise makes purpose, we always rehearse the test beforehand to make sure it’s natural. Basically we test the test!</p>
