					<h1>User Testing Moo</h1>
				</div>
				<p>As one of the coolest London start-ups around, Moo are constantly finding new and improved ways of helping people create their own unique set of business cards. We were brought on board to orchestrate usability testing for their latest product ‘Quick and Easy’.</p>

			<h2>Understanding the goals</h2>
			<p>The UX team at Moo had designed a new online tool which helps people make cool, professional business cards fast!  The idea was to strip it right back to just the essential tools with few formatting options and test potential customers’ reactions to it. Ultimately, they wanted to know if it live up to it’s name: ‘Quick and Easy’.</p>

			<h2>Interviewing the people</h2>
			<p>With a clear understanding of their testing goals, we scripted a discussion guide to tease out the most honest responses. We used natural usability testing to uncover how the participants reacted to the overal design, inputing their information, chosing and changing their designs and uploading their own artwork.</p>

		<div class="content-panel">
			<h2>The outcomes</h2>
			<p>Moo were looking to react quickly to the results of the the testing so we provided our headline findings 24 hours after testing, flagging critical areas of improvement. That was followed up 3 days later with a comprehensive document, presentation and workshop with the Moo team where we analysed the overall success of the design, individual user expérience and interaction issues, accompanied with a thorough set of recommended improvements.
